## Problem Defination
- finding out the empty parking spaces in a car-parking-lot aotomatically from servillance camera.

## solution
- Extracting the parking lot coordinates form the image by car_park_coordinate_generator.py script.
- Then use this coordinates to processing every car parking space individualy.
- Implementing digital iamge processing techniques to find out the empty and occupied parking spaces.
- drawing the reults into the image. 

## Used The Concepts
